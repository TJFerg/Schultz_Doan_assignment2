Compiling
---------
Ensure you are in the correct assignment directory (Schultz-Doan-assignment2).

Then simply run:
make compile

gcc version 6.2.0 was used to compile for testing.

To compile manually, run the following:
g++ -g -Wall -O0 -pedantic-errors -o main ItemType.cpp SortedLinkedList.cpp main.cpp 

To run
------
Simply run:
make run

To run manually, run the following:
./main

After running
-------------
If you want, you can run the following:
make clean

Or, run: rm main.

This deletes the 'main' executable file.
