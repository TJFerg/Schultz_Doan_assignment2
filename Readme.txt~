README
==============================================

Group members
-------------
Austin Schultz - als93978@uga.edu
       * Contributions: Worked on and completed Student class,
       Instructor class, and Main.

David Doan - dd67391@uga.edu
       * Contributions: Worked on and completed the Instructor class.
       We had to use Austin's code for the Instructor class due to a time issue,
       but this shouldn't penalize him because he completed the code.

Compiling
---------
Ensure you are in the correct assignment directory (Schultz-Doan-assignment1).

Then simply run:
make compile

gcc version 6.2.0 was used to compile for testing.

To compile manually, run the following:
g++ -g -Wall -O0 -pedantic-errors -o main Student.cpp Instructor.cpp main.cpp 

To run
------
Simply run:
make run

To run manually, run the following:
./main instructors.txt students.txt

After running
-------------
If you want, you can run the following:
make clean

Or, run: rm main.

This deletes the 'main' executable file.
